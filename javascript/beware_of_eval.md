# Beware of eval

> eval() is a dangerous function, which executes the code it's passed with the privileges of the caller. If you run eval() with a string that could be 
> affected by a malicious party, you may end up running malicious code on the user's machine with the permissions of your webpage / extension. More  
> importantly, a third-party code can see the scope in which eval() was invoked, which can lead to possible attacks in ways to which the similar 
> Function is not susceptible.
